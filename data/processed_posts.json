Here\u2019s what\u2019s helped me the most:\n\nStep 1: Get Clear on Your Direction\nWhat kind of roles excite you? What industries align with your values?\n\nStep 2: Build a Smart Job Search System\nUse Trello or Notion to track applications\nSet daily/weekly application goals\nMaintain a spreadsheet with company research\n\nStep 3: Optimize Your Profile\nUpdate your LinkedIn\nUse strong keywords\nShow your personality and passion\n\nStep 4: Network Authentically\nReach out to alumni, colleagues, or people in your target industry\nDon\u2019t just ask for a job\u2014ask for advice, share ideas, be human\n\nStep 5: Reflect Often\nRejections hurt, but every one brings you closer to your \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nRemember: you only need one right opportunity.\n\nIf you're on the hunt, you're not alone.
